            <span class="effective-date">Effective Date: December 30, 2025</span>
        </header>

        <section class="policy-content">
            <p>This privacy policy applies to the ClariRate app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Oleksandr Holyshevskyi (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address).</li>
                <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and the time spent on those pages.</li>
                <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device.</li>
                <li><strong>Advertising ID (IDFA/GAID):</strong> Used to provide personalized advertisements and analytics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Notifications</h2>
            <p>The Application uses local notifications to provide Smart Alerts (e.g., long session warnings or pause reminders). These notifications are scheduled locally on your device and do not transmit your usage data to external servers.</p>

            <h2>Location Information</h2>
            <p>The Application <strong>does not</strong> request or collect precise geographical location data from your mobile device for its core functionality (time tracking).</p>
            <p>However, the Application integrates third-party services (such as AdMob) which may collect and use approximate location data derived from your IP address to serve relevant advertisements and analyze ad performance.</p>

            <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
            <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>
            <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google AdMob</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://expo.dev/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expo</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueCat</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>In-App Purchases and Payments</h2>
            <p>The Application offers in-app purchases handled via the Apple App Store. The Service Provider <strong>does not collect or store your financial information</strong> (e.g., credit card numbers). All financial transactions are processed securely by Apple. The Service Provider only receives a confirmation of the transaction and subscription status via RevenueCat to unlock premium features.</p>

            <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
            <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>
            <p>You may also opt-out of personalized advertising tracking through your device settings (Settings > Privacy > Tracking on iOS).</p>

            <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. If you'd like them to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Application, please contact them at <a href="mailto:holyshevskyi.a@gmail.com">holyshevskyi.a@gmail.com</a> and they will respond in a reasonable time.</p>

            <h2>Children</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>
            <p>The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case the Service Provider discover that a child under 13 has provided personal information, the Service Provider will immediately delete this from their servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact the Service Provider so that they will be able to take the necessary actions.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information the Service Provider processes and maintains.</p>

            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>
